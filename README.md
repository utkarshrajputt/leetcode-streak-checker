# ⚡ LeetCode Streak Checker Bot 🔔

> A daily reminder bot that keeps your LeetCode streak alive—or roasts you if you slack.

This GitHub Action checks if you've submitted any problem on LeetCode today. If you haven't, it sends a Telegram message at **10:15 PM IST** to guilt-trip you into staying consistent.

If you have submitted? You get some motivational praise instead. Because you earned it.
